# Growth Mindset means being teachable throughout life.
## Not allowing the thoughts of what I can't do interefere with thoughts of possibility.
### For me, being able to be open to new opportunities helps me to stay in a growth mindset because, I know that I can do anything that I put my mind to.
**Having a growth mindset has changed the way that I talk as well as my perception on life. I am constantly turning my negative words into positive actions.**
__I believe that in this life, you must have a growth mindset if you ever expect to accomplish anything because everything is always changing.__
