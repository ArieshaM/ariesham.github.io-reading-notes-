      <header> <strong>What is HTML</strong> </header>
        <p>HTML is HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
      

         <h2><strong>What are the 3 main parts of an HTML Element</strong></h2>
            <ul>

               <li> opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
               <li>closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
               <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
            
            </ul>
    
         <h2><strong>What is it called when you give an element extra information?</strong></h2>
               <p>An Attribute.Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.</p>
               <p>Attributes that set a value always have</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
                     <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                     <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
                  
                  </ul>

         <h2><strong>What is a semantic element?</strong></h2>
               </p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.</p>
