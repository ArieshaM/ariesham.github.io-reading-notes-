# Operators and Loops

## What is an expression in JavaScrip

At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

Operators join operands either formed by higher-precedence operators or one of the basic expressions.

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.
There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

for statement
do...while statement
while statement
labeled statement
break statement
continue statement
for...in statement
for...of statement

### When does a for loop stop executing?

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.
Here is how a loop executes in Java Scrip

-The initializing expression initialization, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.

-The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates. (If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)

-The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.

-If present, the update expression afterthought is executed.

-Control returns to Step 2.

## How many times will a while loop execute?

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.

To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.
