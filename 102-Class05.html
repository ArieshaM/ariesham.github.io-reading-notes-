        <header> <strong> <h2>What is CSS</h2></strong></header>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages.
            CSS allows you to add color, creativity, and charisma to your HTML.</p>

            <header> <strong> <h2> What is the purpose of CSS</h2></strong></header>

            <p> The purpose of CSS is to convert text into a form usable by the audience. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling â€” for example, for changing the
                color and the size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout such as turning a column of text into a single layout with a sidebar and a content area and sidebar with
                related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.  
                
                <header> <strong> <h2>CSS Syntax</h2></strong></header>
                <p> CSS is a rule-based language. you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
                    </p>
                        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS#:~:text=styling%20described%20above%3A-,CSS,%7B%0A%20%20color%3A%20red%3B%0A%20%20font%2Dsize%3A%205em%3B%0A%7D,-In%20the%20above" alt="CSS Example">
            
                        <ul>In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector.
                            This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. 
                            <li>In this case we are styling level one headings (h1).</li>
                            
                            <li>We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside the braces will be one or more declerations, which take the form of property and value pairs</li>
                            
                            <li>We then specify the property (colorin the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property after the colon (red in this example)</li>
        
                            <li>
                                This example contains two declerations, one for color and the other for font-size.
                                Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting (h1 in this case), then a value that we'd like to give the property.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                             
                             
                    </p>

                <header> <strong> <h2> What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project</h2></strong></header>

                <p><ul><li><h4>External CSS</h4></li></ul>
                    With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

                    Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the link element, inside the head section.
                    An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.
                    The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags</p>
                
                    <p><ul><li><h4>Internal CSS</h4></li></ul>
                        An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

                        The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the head section.

                    </p>

                <p><ul><li><h4>Inline CSS</h4></li></ul>
                    An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

                    To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.</p>

                <header><strong><h2>Check out this Example 

                </h2></strong></header>
                <P>The example below demonstrates how to use CSS to 
                    make everything with a < p> red.
                    <ul><li> p { 
                       color: red; 
                    }
                    <img src="p {
                        color: green;
                      }
                      " alt="example of css">
                    </li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
    </main>
