# Learning the Software Life!

 I am Ariesha Murray. I currently reside in Oklahoma City and this is my journey to becoming a Full-Stack web developer.

As a student with Code Fellows, I am excited to gain new skills and perhaps become a great software developer.

This website will contain all that I have done and or learned during my time with Code Fellows.
