# Learning the Software Life!

 I am Ariesha Murray. I currently reside in Oklahoma City and this is my journey to becoming a Full-Stack web developer.

As a student with Code Fellows, I am excited to gain new skills and perhaps become a great software developer.

This website will contain all that I have done and or learned during my time with Code Fellows.

## Growth Mindset
Being teachable throughout life is my definition of having a Growth Mindset.
I choose to not allow thoughts of negativity or doubt interefer with the possibilities of doing great things. Having a growth mindset has changed the way that I think, talk, and perceive my life.

## My Commitment to cultivate a Growth Mindset

- I commit to turning my negative words into positive actions.

- I commit to having a growth mindset as I learn the world of software development.

- I commit to finish strong. I will never quit or give up because that totally goes against having a growth mindset.
