## Ordered and Unordered List

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
The <ul> element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square. The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.

2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.

3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
The <ol> and <ul> elements both represent a list of items. They differ in that, with the <ol> element, the order is meaningful. To determine which one to use, try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning is changed, the <ol> element should be used, otherwise you can use <ul>.

4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
By nesting or CSS.

## The Box Model

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

The margin character is an invisible space around your box. It pushes other elements away from the box. Margins can have positive or negative values. The padding character sits between the border and the content area and is used to push the content away from the border. Unlike margins, you cannot have a negative padding.

2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

Margin: The margin is an invisible space around your box.
Border:The border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box.
Padding:The padding sits between the border and the content area and is used to push the content away from the border. 
Size: The width and length of the box.

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?

List-Like data types. An array can store various data types — strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays. Array's also mix data types in a single array — not limited  to storing only numbers in one array, and in another only strings.

2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?.

Yes. You can access the stored values by using a number to identify what part of the array you want to access. If you want to acces the name of the people you would use: console.log (people[0]); and this will return the name of the person.

3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

1. Addition Assignment: Means X = X + f()
2. Subtraction Assignment: Means X = X - f()
3. Multiplication Assignment: Means x = X * f()
4. Assignment : Means X = f()
5. Division: Means  X = X/f()

4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
