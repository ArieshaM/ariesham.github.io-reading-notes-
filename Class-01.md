## Parsing HTML, JavaScript, & CSS files

The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any <link>-element references to external CSS stylesheets and any <script>-element references to scripts.
As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from <link> elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from <script> elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript.
The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.
As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it.

## Finding images for webpages

To choose an image, go to Google Images and search for something suitable.

When you find the image you want, click on the image to get an enlarged view of it.
Right-click the image (Ctrl + click on a Mac), choose Save Image As…, and choose a safe place to save your image. Alternatively, copy the image's web address from your browser's address bar for later use.
Use images that have Creative Commons licensing to prevent copyright infringement.

## How do you create a string vs a number in JavaScript?

A string is created by a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.
Example
let myVariable = 'orange juice'; or
let myVariable = "orange juice";

A number is created based on numbers don't have quotes around them.
Example
let myVariable = 20;

## What is a Variable?

Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
Example
let myVariable

# Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.

## What is an HTML Attribute

Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.
An attribute should have:

A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)
The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote mark

## HTML Anatomy

The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.

## The Difference between and article and a section

<article> encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).
<section> is similar to <article>, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries), or a theme. It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that you can break <article>s up into different <section>s, or <section>s up into different <article>s, depending on the context.

## Basic Website elements

Header
Navigation Bar
Main Content
Sidebar
Footer

## How does Metadata influence Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Most of the information is found in the head and it makes it more concise when searching. 

## How is the meta HTML tag used when specifiying metadata

Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document — the <meta> element. There are a lot of different types of <meta> elements that can be included in your page's <head>. 

## How to start planning a website

1. Putting your ideas down on paper.
2. What exactly do I want to accomplish?

## HTML Semantics

You use the <ht> heading over the span so that your heading has more styling choices. HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.

## What is JavaScript?
1. Modifying HTML and CSS are needed in the browser. The server side and the client side of the website need JavaScript.
2. JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses <link> elements to apply external stylesheets and <style> elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML — the <script> element. Let's learn how this works.
